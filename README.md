# McGill-MECH539

This is a project repository for "MECH 539: Computational Aerodynamics" taugh by Professor Sivakumaran Nadarajah at McGill University (Winter 2013).

From [McGill University Mechanical Engineering: MECH 539](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2015-2016/courses/mech-539), this course teaches followings:

- Basic flow singularities.
- Boundary element methods. 
- Source, doublet and vortex panel methods for 2D and 3D incompressible and compressible flows. 
- Method of characteristics. 
- Euler equations for inviscid rotational flows. 
- Finite-difference and finite-volume methods. 
- Explicit and implicit time-integration methods. 
- Quasi 1D solutions. 
- Nozzle and confined aerofoil applications.

For details of the course, please refer to [Course Syllabus (Winter 2013)]()

During this course, 6 projects were completed:

1. Numerical Methods for One-Dimensional Wave Equation
2. Compare Jacobi, Gauss_seidel, and Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) methods by writing given numerical codes to solve a linear system on different grid sizes
3. Murman-Cole Scheme for the Transonic Small Disturbance Equation
4. Investigating Aerodynamic Performance of Airfoils using a Coupled Potential Equation and Integral Boundary Layer Method
5. Solve the Quasi One-Dimensional Euler Equations for a Supersonic Nozzle 
6. (Final Project) Solve the Quasi One-Dimensional Euler Equations for Various Artificial Dissipation Schemes

Each project was created and committed to separate subfolders within this repository. All codes were written in MATLAB script (I am sorry..) and test reports were created in pdf format.
